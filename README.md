# LoL-API-challenge-2.0

With this project I try to show how the recent patch 5.13 influenced the choices players make, regarding the use of ability power items. My focus lies on the percentage of games in which certain items were bought, combination of items that may have gained more usage (e.g. Liandry's Torment + Rylai's Crystal Scepter) and the average amount of ability power provided by the builds before and after the patch.

# Given Data

For this purpose I used the data sets provided by Riot Games. Each of the four data sets contains the IDs of 100,000 matches divided between ten servers.
The data sets represent two different patches (5.11,5.14) with two different modes (normal 5v5, solo ranked).
